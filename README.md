## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
Hello! I'm Furkan Eren GÃ¼lÃ§ay, a second-year Computer Engineering student at Marmara University. I primarily work with Java and C, which are the languages I feel most confident in. Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on learning Python to expand my programming skills and explore new areas in software development. This GitHub account is where I share my course assignments, personal projects, and experimental work as I continue to grow as a developer. I am committed to writing clean and efficient code and continuously strive to improve my programming skills.
